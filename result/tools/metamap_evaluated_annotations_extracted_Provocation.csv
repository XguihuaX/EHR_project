For the ground truth ""worse with eating,"" and the prediction ""Chief Complaint Intermittently Present,"" I would say that they are not semantically similar.

After evaluating the two phrases, I would classify them as semantically dissimilar. Although both phrases mention a negative effect of eating, the common topic of information is not the same. The ground truth phrase ""worse with eating"" implies a worsening of a condition or symptom due to eating, while the prediction phrase ""Nausea, CTCAE 5.0"" mentions a specific symptom of nausea and a grading system (CTCAE 5.0) that is not directly related to the topic of eating.

So, the ground truth is ""worse with eating"" and the prediction is ""Dizziness, CTCAE 3.0""? Let me evaluate their similarity...

After evaluating the two phrases, I would say that they are not semantically similar. The ground truth phrase ""worse with eating"" refers to the worsening of a condition or symptom due to eating, while the prediction phrase ""Dizziness, CTCAE 3.0"" refers to a specific type of dizziness and a rating scale used to assess adverse events.

Text: Ground Truth: worse with deep breathing 
 Prediction: Chills, CTCAE 

[/INST]  Sure, I'm ready to help! Please provide the ground truth and the prediction, and I'll evaluate their similarity based on the information you provided.

So, the ground truth is ""worse with deep breathing"" and the prediction is ""Chills, CTCAE""? Let me evaluate their similarity...

After evaluating the two phrases, I would say that they are not semantically similar. The ground truth phrase ""worse with deep breathing"" describes a specific symptom or effect, while the prediction phrase ""Chills, CTCAE"" describes two different things: a physical sensation (chills) and a medical classification (CTCAE). Therefore, the two phrases do not express the same information or concept, and they are not semantically similar.

So, my answer is: @Dissimilar@.",

[/INST]  Sure, I'm ready to help! Based on the information you've provided, I can evaluate the similarity or dissimilarity of the ground truth and the prediction.

In this case, the ground truth is ""worse with deep breathing"" and the prediction is ""Nausea, CTCAE 5.0"".

To evaluate the similarity of these two phrases, I will follow the steps you outlined:

1. Identify the common topic of information: Both phrases are talking about negative effects or symptoms related to cancer treatment.
2. Determine the respective piece of information supporting the common topic:
	* Ground truth: worse with deep breathing
	* Prediction: Nausea
3. Evaluate the similarity of the two phrases: Although both phrases mention negative effects related to cancer treatment, they do not mean the same thing. ""Worse with deep breathing"" implies that the patient experiences worsening symptoms when taking deep breaths, while ""Nausea"" is a specific symptom that can be caused by various factors, including cancer treatment. Therefore, the two phrases are not semantically similar.

Text: Ground Truth: worse with deep breathing 
 Prediction: Family history: Hypertension 

[/INST]  Sure, I'm ready to help! Please provide the ground truth and the prediction, and I'll evaluate them based on the criteria you've outlined.

Ground Truth: worse with deep breathing
Prediction: Family history: Hypertension

Based on the information provided, I would classify the ground truth and prediction as ""Dissimilar"". The ground truth refers to the worsening of a condition with deep breathing, while the prediction mentions a family history of hypertension. These are two distinct and unrelated concepts, and therefore they are not semantically similar.

 Prediction: Intercurrent Illness is Absent at Onset of Chief Complaint 

[/INST]  Sure, I'm ready to help! The ground truth is ""worse with deep breathing"" and the prediction is ""Intercurrent Illness is Absent at Onset of Chief Complaint"".

To evaluate the similarity of these two phrases, I will follow the steps you outlined:

1. Identify the common topic of information: Both phrases are talking about the patient's condition.
2. Determine the respective piece of information supporting the common topic:
	* Phrase1: worse with deep breathing
	* Phrase2: Intercurrent Illness is Absent at Onset of Chief Complaint
3. Evaluate the similarity of the two phrases: They do not mean the same as the phrases describe different aspects of the patient's condition. Phrase1 mentions the patient's experience of worsening symptoms with deep breathing, while Phrase2 mentions the absence of intercurrent illness at the onset of the chief complaint.
4. Final answer: @Dissimilar@

Therefore, I conclude that the two phrases are dissimilar and do not convey the same information.",

[/INST]  Sure, I'm ready to help! Based on the information you've provided, I can evaluate the similarity or dissimilarity of the ground truth and prediction.

For the ground truth ""worse with deep breathing,"" and the prediction ""no,"" I would say that they are not semantically similar. The ground truth describes a negative effect of deep breathing, while the prediction simply states the absence of something (in this case, no negative effect).

[/INST]  Sure, I'm ready to help! Based on the information you've provided, here's my evaluation of the ground truth and prediction:

Ground Truth: aggravated with movement

Ground Truth: aggravated with movement

After evaluating the two phrases, I would classify them as semantically dissimilar. The common topic of information is the concept of movement, but the two phrases express unrelated ideas. ""Aggravated with movement"" implies that the movement causes some negative effect, while ""Occur (action)"" is a vague phrase that could refer to any action happening.

 Prediction: Lacks Energy 

[/INST]  Sure, I'm ready to help! Based on the information you've provided, here's my evaluation of the ground truth and prediction:

Ground Truth: exacerbated on exertion

Prediction: Lacks Energy

Common topic of information: Both phrases are talking about the impact of physical activity on the patient's condition.

Respective piece of information supporting the common topic:

Ground Truth: exacerbated on exertion

Prediction: Lacks Energy

Evaluate the similarity of the two phrases: They do not mean the same as ""exacerbated on exertion"" and ""lacks energy"" are not synonymous and have different connotations.

Ground Truth: exacerbated on exertion
Prediction: History of recurrent pneumonia

After evaluating the two phrases, I would say that they are not semantically similar. The ground truth phrase ""exacerbated on exertion"" describes a specific symptom or condition, while the prediction phrase ""History of recurrent pneumonia"" describes a broader medical history.

For the ground truth ""exacerbated on exertion"", I can identify the common topic of information as ""exertion"" and the respective piece of information supporting this topic is ""exacerbated"".

After evaluating the similarity of the two phrases, I determine that they are not semantically similar.

So, the ground truth is ""exacerbated on exertion"" and the prediction is ""Syncope, CTCAE 5.0""? Let me evaluate their similarity...

After evaluating the two phrases, I would say that they are not semantically similar. The ground truth phrase ""exacerbated on exertion"" refers to an increase in symptoms or severity of a condition when one engages in physical activity, while the prediction phrase ""Syncope, CTCAE 5.0"" refers to a specific type of fainting or loss of consciousness. Although both phrases relate to medical conditions, they do not express the same idea or concept, so I would classify them as dissimilar.

So, the ground truth is ""exacerbated on exertion"" and the prediction is ""Medical History""? Let me evaluate them based on the examples you provided.

First, I'll identify the common topic of information: Both phrases are talking about the patient's medical history.

Next, I'll determine the respective piece of information supporting the common topic:

Ground Truth: exacerbated on exertion

You are a language model that is used for the evaluation of model 
predictions against the ground truth. I will be providing you with two phrases and your task is to tell me
if they are semantically similar or not. Please consider the meaning of words, the context in which they appear and any implied
or explicit relationships between the phrases.

Semantically similar phrases are phrases that describe the same event or action eventhough they dont use the exact same words.

Specifically,
a) The two phrases mean the same
b) The common subset of information means the same

Semantically dissimilar phrases are phrases that describe different events, actions, or concepts or if they differ
significantly in meaning, context or intent. In other words, phrases that express unrelated or contradictory ideas, or 
that have different connotations are considered semantically dissimilar.

[/INST]  Sure, I'm ready to help! Please provide the ground truth and the prediction, and I will evaluate their semantic similarity or dissimilarity based on the examples and reasoning steps you provided.

Ground Truth: exacerbated on exertion
Prediction: Intercurrent Illness is Absent at Onset of Chief Complaint

After evaluating the two phrases, I would classify them as semantically dissimilar. While both phrases are related to the patient's symptoms, they do not convey the same information. The ground truth phrase ""exacerbated on exertion"" specifically mentions that the patient's symptoms worsen when they engage in physical activity, while the prediction phrase ""Intercurrent Illness is Absent at Onset of Chief Complaint"" is stating that there is no other illness present at the start of the patient's main symptom. Therefore, the two phrases do not have the same meaning, and I would classify them as dissimilar.

Text: Ground Truth: exacerbated on exertion

[/INST]  Sure, I'm ready to help! Please provide the ground truth and the prediction, and I'll let you know if they are similar or dissimilar.

Ground Truth: exacerbated on exertion
Prediction: Unintentional Material Aspiration

Hmm, let me think...

Based on the common topic of information, both phrases are talking about some kind of physical sensation or experience. However, the specific information supported by each phrase is quite different.

The ground truth phrase ""exacerbated on exertion"" suggests that the person's symptoms are made worse by physical activity, while the prediction phrase ""Unintentional Material Aspiration"" doesn't seem to have any direct relationship to physical activity or symptoms.

Therefore, I would classify these phrases as dissimilar.

Text: Ground Truth: worse with inhaling 
 Prediction: Cocaine user 

[/INST]  Sure, I'm ready to help! Please provide the ground truth and the prediction, and I'll evaluate them based on the criteria you've provided.

Ground Truth: worse with inhaling
Prediction: Cocaine user

Hmm, let me think...

The common topic of information in both phrases is the effect of drug use on the body.

The piece of information supporting the common topic in the ground truth is ""worse with inhaling"".

The piece of information supporting the common topic in the prediction is ""Cocaine user"".

Hmm, these two phrases don't seem to mean the same thing. The ground truth phrase mentions a specific action (inhaling) and the prediction phrase mentions a specific drug (Cocaine). So, I would say that these phrases are not semantically similar.

Ground Truth: worse with inhaling

After evaluating the two phrases, I would classify them as semantically dissimilar.

 Prediction: Pain, CTCAE 

[/INST]  Sure, I'm ready to help! Please provide the ground truth and the prediction, and I'll evaluate their semantic similarity or dissimilarity based on the examples and reasoning steps you provided.

Ground Truth: worse with exertion and movement
Prediction: Pain, CTCAE

After evaluating the two phrases, I would classify them as semantically dissimilar. While both phrases mention pain, the common topic of information is not the same. The ground truth phrase mentions that the pain is worse with exertion and movement, while the prediction phrase simply mentions pain and CTCAE (a clinical grading system for adverse events). Therefore, the two phrases do not express the same information or convey the same meaning, and are considered semantically dissimilar.

Text: Ground Truth: worse with exertion and movement 
 Prediction: Normal Abdomen on Palpation 

[/INST]  Sure, I'm ready to help! Based on the information you've provided, I can evaluate the similarity or dissimilarity of the ground truth and prediction.

For the ground truth ""worse with exertion and movement"", I can identify the common topic of information as ""physical symptoms"". The respective piece of information supporting this common topic is ""worse with exertion and movement"".

For the prediction ""Normal Abdomen on Palpation"", I can also identify the common topic of information as ""physical symptoms"". The respective piece of information supporting this common topic is ""Normal Abdomen on Palpation"".

After evaluating the similarity of the two phrases, I can determine that they are not semantically similar. The ground truth mentions specific physical symptoms that are worse with exertion and movement, while the prediction only mentions a normal abdomen on palpation, which does not convey the same level of detail or specificity. Therefore, my answer is '@Dissimilar@'.",

[/INST]  Sure, I'm ready to help! Please provide the ground truth and the prediction, and I'll evaluate their semantic similarity based on the steps you outlined.

Ground Truth: worse with exertion and movement
Prediction: Rating (action)

After identifying the common topic of information (both phrases are talking about the effect of physical activity on the condition), I determine that the respective piece of information supporting the common topic is ""worse with exertion and movement"" for the ground truth, and ""Rating (action)"" for the prediction.

Evaluating the similarity of the two phrases, I conclude that they are not semantically similar. The ground truth phrase specifically mentions the worsening of the condition with physical activity, while the prediction phrase is a more general term that could refer to any rating or evaluation of an action. Therefore, the final answer is ""@Dissimilar@"".",

After evaluating the two phrases, I would classify them as semantically dissimilar. The ground truth phrase describes the exacerbation of pain when the patient is sitting up, while the prediction phrase mentions two specific medical conditions (Pain NOS and CTCAE) without providing any information about the patient's position or activity. Therefore, the two phrases do not convey the same information, and they are not semantically similar.

You are a language model that is used for the evaluation of model 
predictions against the ground truth. I will be providing you with two phrases and your task is to tell me
if they are semantically similar or not. Please consider the meaning of words, the context in which they appear and any implied
or explicit relationships between the phrases.

Semantically similar phrases are phrases that describe the same event or action eventhough they dont use the exact same words.

Specifically,
a) The two phrases mean the same
b) The common subset of information means the same

Semantically dissimilar phrases are phrases that describe different events, actions, or concepts or if they differ
significantly in meaning, context or intent. In other words, phrases that express unrelated or contradictory ideas, or 
that have different connotations are considered semantically dissimilar.  

Specifically,
a) The two phrases do not mean the same:
b) The common subset of information does not mean the same:

Ground Truth: worsens with coughing or taking a deep breath
Prediction: Nausea, CTCAE 3.0

After evaluating the two phrases, I would classify them as semantically dissimilar. Although both phrases mention symptoms related to respiratory and gastrointestinal systems, they do not share the same information or meaning. The ground truth phrase specifically mentions that the symptoms worsen with coughing or taking a deep breath, while the prediction phrase mentions nausea and uses a specific grading system (CTCAE 3.0). Therefore, the two phrases do not express the same information or have the same meaning, and I would classify them as semantically dissimilar.

You are a language model that is used for the evaluation of model 
predictions against the ground truth. I will be providing you with two phrases and your task is to tell me
if they are semantically similar or not. Please consider the meaning of words, the context in which they appear and any implied
or explicit relationships between the phrases.

Semantically similar phrases are phrases that describe the same event or action eventhough they dont use the exact same words.

Specifically,
a) The two phrases mean the same
b) The common subset of information means the same

Semantically dissimilar phrases are phrases that describe different events, actions, or concepts or if they differ
significantly in meaning, context or intent. In other words, phrases that express unrelated or contradictory ideas, or 
that have different connotations are considered semantically dissimilar.  

Specifically,
a) The two phrases do not mean the same:
b) The common subset of information does not mean the same:

 Prediction: H/O: hypertension 

[/INST]  Sure, I'm ready to help! Based on the information you've provided, I can evaluate the similarity or dissimilarity of the ground truth and the prediction.

Ground Truth: worsens with coughing or taking a deep breath
Prediction: H/O: hypertension

1) Identify common topic of information: Both phrases are talking about the worsening of a condition.
2) Determine the respective piece of information supporting the common topic:
    Ground Truth: worsens with coughing or taking a deep breath
    Prediction: H/O: hypertension
3) Evaluate the similarity of the two phrases: They do not mean the same as the ground truth refers to a specific set of symptoms, while the prediction is a broader diagnosis.
4) Final answer: @Dissimilar@

Therefore, the prediction ""H/O: hypertension"" is not similar to the ground truth ""worsens with coughing or taking a deep breath"".",

Text: Ground Truth: worse with exertion 
 Prediction: Nausea, CTCAE 5.0 

[/INST]  Sure, I'm ready to help! Please provide the ground truth and the prediction, and I'll evaluate them based on the criteria you've provided.

Ground Truth: worse with exertion
Prediction: Nausea, CTCAE 5.0

After evaluating the two phrases, I would classify them as semantically dissimilar. Although both phrases are related to medical symptoms, they do not convey the same information. ""Worse with exertion"" implies that the symptoms worsen when the patient engages in physical activity, while ""Nausea, CTCAE 5.0"" is a specific diagnosis code for nausea and does not provide any information about exertion. Therefore, the two phrases do not mean the same, and I would classify them as dissimilar.

Text: Ground Truth: worse with exertion 
 Prediction: Medical History 

[/INST]  Sure, I'm ready to help! Please provide the ground truth and the prediction, and I'll evaluate them based on the criteria you've provided.

Ground Truth: worse with exertion
Prediction: Medical History

After evaluating the two phrases, I would classify them as semantically dissimilar. While both phrases mention information related to health, they do not convey the same meaning. The ground truth phrase ""worse with exertion"" implies that the condition worsens when the person engages in physical activity, while the prediction phrase ""Medical History"" does not convey any information about the condition worsening with exertion. Therefore, the two phrases do not mean the same, and I would classify them as dissimilar.

Ground Truth: worse with inspiration
Prediction: Cough, CTCAE

After evaluating the two phrases, I would classify them as semantically dissimilar. Although both phrases mention medical conditions, they do not share a common topic or meaning. The ground truth phrase ""worse with inspiration"" refers to the worsening of a medical condition due to breathing in, while the prediction phrase ""Cough, CTCAE"" refers to two specific symptoms of a medical condition. Therefore, the two phrases do not mean the same and are not semantically similar.

Text: Ground Truth: worse with inspiration 
 Prediction: Vomiting, CTCAE 

[/INST]  Sure, I'm ready to help! Please provide the ground truth and the prediction, and I'll evaluate them based on the criteria you've provided.

Ground Truth: worse with inspiration
Prediction: Vomiting, CTCAE

After evaluating the two phrases, I would classify them as semantically dissimilar. While both phrases are related to negative health effects, they do not share the same meaning or information. The ground truth phrase ""worse with inspiration"" implies that the subject's symptoms worsen when they inhale, while the prediction phrase ""Vomiting, CTCAE"" refers to two specific symptoms, vomiting and CTCAE (a scale used to measure the severity of adverse events), but does not provide any information about the subject's inspiration. Therefore, I would classify the two phrases as dissimilar.

Ground Truth: pain is worse with inspiration
Prediction: Dyspnea, CTCAE

After evaluating the two phrases, I would classify them as dissimilar. While both phrases mention symptoms related to respiratory distress, the common subset of information does not mean the same. ""Pain is worse with inspiration"" specifically refers to the exacerbation of pain when inhaling, whereas ""Dyspnea"" is a general term for shortness of breath, and ""CTCAE"" is a specific grading system for adverse events. Therefore, the two phrases do not express the same information or concept, and are dissimilar.
