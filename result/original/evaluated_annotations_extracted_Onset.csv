Semantically similar phrases are phrases that describe the same event or action eventhough they dont use the exact same words.

Specifically,
a) The two phrases mean the same
b) The common subset of information means the same

Semantically dissimilar phrases are phrases that describe different events, actions, or concepts or if they differ
significantly in meaning, context or intent. In other words, phrases that express unrelated or contradictory ideas, or 
that have different connotations are considered semantically dissimilar.  

Specifically,
a) The two phrases do not mean the same:
b) The common subset of information does not mean the same:

You are a language model that is used for the evaluation of model 
predictions against the ground truth. I will be providing you with two phrases and your task is to tell me
if they are semantically similar or not. Please consider the meaning of words, the context in which they appear and any implied

Semantically similar phrases are phrases that describe the same event or action eventhough they dont use the exact same words.

Specifically,
a) The two phrases mean the same
b) The common subset of information means the same

Semantically dissimilar phrases are phrases that describe different events, actions, or concepts or if they differ
significantly in meaning, context or intent. In other words, phrases that express unrelated or contradictory ideas, or 
that have different connotations are considered semantically dissimilar.  

Specifically,
a) The two phrases do not mean the same:

[/INST]  Sure, I'm ready to help! Based on the information you've provided, I can evaluate the similarity between the ground truth and the prediction.

For the ground truth ""3-4 days ago"" and the prediction ""3 days ago"", I can identify the common topic of information as the time duration. The respective piece of information supporting the common topic is the number of days.

I can evaluate the similarity of the two phrases by determining if they convey the same information. In this case, both phrases describe a time duration of 3 days, so they are semantically similar.

You are a language model that is used for the evaluation of model 
predictions against the ground truth. I will be providing you with two phrases and your task is to tell me
if they are semantically similar or not. Please consider the meaning of words, the context in which they appear and any implied
or explicit relationships between the phrases.

Semantically similar phrases are phrases that describe the same event or action eventhough they dont use the exact same words.

Specifically,
a) The two phrases mean the same
b) The common subset of information means the same

Semantically dissimilar phrases are phrases that describe different events, actions, or concepts or if they differ
significantly in meaning, context or intent. In other words, phrases that express unrelated or contradictory ideas, or 
that have different connotations are considered semantically dissimilar.  

Specifically,
a) The two phrases do not mean the same:
b) The common subset of information does not mean the same: 

<</SYS>>

Now I will provide you with examples and the reasoning steps for semantically similar phrases.

Example1: Ground Truth: '24 hours ago' and Prediction: '1 day ago' 

1) Identify common topic of information: Both phrases are talking about time.
2) Determine the respective piece of information supporting the common topic:
    Phrase1: 24 hours ago 
    Phrase2:  1 day ago 
3) Evaluate the similarity of the two phrases: They mean the same as 24 hours ago and 1 day are the same time duration.
4) Final answer: @Similar@


Example2: Ground Truth: 'pain in left arm and shoulder' and Prediction: 'pain in left arm'

1) Identify common topic of information: Both phrases are talking about pain in the arm
2) Determine the respective piece of information supporting the common topic:
    Phrase1: pain in left arm
    Phrase2:  pain in left arm
3) Evaluate the similarity of the two phrases: They mean the same as both phrases mention that pain is in left arm.
4) Final answer: @Similar@

Example3: Ground Truth: 'pain in the left arm and shoulder' and Prediction:  'pain in the left arm and left side of chest'

1) Identify common topic of information: Both phrases are talking about pain in the arm.
2) Determine the respective piece of information supporting the common topic:
    Phrase1: pain in left arm
    Phrase2:  pain in left arm
3) Evaluate the similarity of the two phrases: They mean the same as both phrases mention that pain is in left arm.

You are a language model that is used for the evaluation of model 
predictions against the ground truth. I will be providing you with two phrases and your task is to tell me
if they are semantically similar or not. Please consider the meaning of words, the context in which they appear and any implied
or explicit relationships between the phrases.

Semantically similar phrases are phrases that describe the same event or action eventhough they dont use the exact same words.

Specifically,
a) The two phrases mean the same
b) The common subset of information means the same

Semantically dissimilar phrases are phrases that describe different events, actions, or concepts or if they differ
significantly in meaning, context or intent. In other words, phrases that express unrelated or contradictory ideas, or 
that have different connotations are considered semantically dissimilar.  

Specifically,
a) The two phrases do not mean the same:
b) The common subset of information does not mean the same:

[/INST]  Sure, I'm ready to help! Based on the examples and reasoning steps you provided, I can evaluate the similarity of the ground truth and prediction.

Ground Truth: 3 weeks
Prediction: 3 weeks ago this afternoon

1. Identify common topic of information: Both phrases are talking about time.
2. Determine the respective piece of information supporting the common topic:
	Ground Truth: 3 weeks
	Prediction: 3 weeks ago this afternoon
3. Evaluate the similarity of the two phrases: The common subset of information is the time period of 3 weeks. The prediction phrase adds additional information about the time being in the past and the specific time of afternoon, but the ground truth only mentions the duration of 3 weeks. Therefore, the two phrases do not mean the same.

Semantically similar phrases are phrases that describe the same event or action eventhough they dont use the exact same words.

a) The two phrases mean the same
b) The common subset of information means the same

Semantically dissimilar phrases are phrases that describe different events, actions, or concepts or if they differ
significantly in meaning, context or intent. In other words, phrases that express unrelated or contradictory ideas, or 
that have different connotations are considered semantically dissimilar.

 Prediction: this afternoon 
[/INST]  Sure, I'd be happy to help! Based on the examples you provided, I understand that I need to determine if the ground truth and prediction are semantically similar or not.

For the given ground truth and prediction, I can identify the common topic of information as ""this afternoon.""

The respective piece of information supporting the common topic for the ground truth is ""at approximately 2 pm.""

The respective piece of information supporting the common topic for the prediction is ""this afternoon.""

Evaluating the similarity of the two phrases, I can see that they both refer to the same time of day, but the prediction does not provide the specific time like the ground truth does. Therefore, I would classify the ground truth and prediction as ""Dissimilar"" because they do not convey the same level of detail.
